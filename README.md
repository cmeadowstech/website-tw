Redoing my website with Tailwind CSS since Django is way overkill now that I have another app built on top of it. Taking advantage of node.js/Vite for the dev and build process so I'm not using the entire Tailwind CDN.

## /app

This is the application content.

## /infra

This is the Terraform configuration for this site.
